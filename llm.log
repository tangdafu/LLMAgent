TOOL USE

You have access to a set of tools that are executed upon the user's approval. You can use one tool per message, and will receive the result of that tool use in the user's response. You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool use informed by the result of the previous tool use.

# Tool Use Formatting

Tool use is formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:

<tool_name>
<parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
<parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
...
</tool_name>

For example:

<read_file>
<path>src/main.js</path>
</read_file>

Always adhere to this format for the tool use to ensure proper parsing and execution.

# Tools

## execute_command
Description: Request to execute a CLI command on the system. Use this when you need to perform system operations or run specific commands to accomplish any step in the user's task. You must tailor your command to the user's system and provide a clear explanation of what the command does. For command chaining, use the appropriate chaining syntax for the user's shell. Prefer to execute complex CLI commands over creating executable scripts, as they are more flexible and easier to run. Commands will be executed in the current working directory: e:/projects/LLMAgent
Parameters:
- command: (required) The CLI command to execute. This should be valid for the current operating system. Ensure the command is properly formatted and does not contain any harmful instructions.
- requires_approval: (required) A boolean indicating whether this command requires explicit user approval before execution in case the user has auto-approve mode enabled. Set to 'true' for potentially impactful operations like installing/uninstalling packages, deleting/overwriting files, system configuration changes, network operations, or any commands that could have unintended side effects. Set to 'false' for safe operations like reading files/directories, running development servers, building projects, and other non-destructive operations.
Usage:
<execute_command>
<command>Your command here</command>
<requires_approval>true or false</requires_approval>
</execute_command>

## read_file
Description: Request to read the contents of a file at the specified path. Use this when you need to examine the contents of an existing file you do not know the contents of, for example to analyze code, review text files, or extract information from configuration files. Automatically extracts raw text from PDF and DOCX files. May not be suitable for other types of binary files, as it returns the raw content as a string.
Parameters:
- path: (required) The path of the file to read (relative to the current working directory e:/projects/LLMAgent)
Usage:
<read_file>
<path>File path here</path>
</read_file>

## write_to_file
Description: Request to write content to a file at the specified path. If the file exists, it will be overwritten with the provided content. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created. This tool will automatically create any directories needed to write the file.
Parameters:
- path: (required) The path of the file to write to (relative to the current working directory e:/projects/LLMAgent)
- content: (required) The content to write to the file. ALWAYS provide the COMPLETE intended content of the file, without any truncation or omissions. You MUST include ALL parts of the file, even if they haven't been modified.
Usage:
<write_to_file>
<path>File path here</path>
<content>
Your file content here
</content>
</write_to_file>

## replace_in_file
Description: Request to replace sections of content in an existing file using SEARCH/REPLACE blocks that define exact changes to specific parts of the file. This tool should be used when you need to make targeted changes to specific parts of a file.
Parameters:
- path: (required) The path of the file to modify (relative to the current working directory e:/projects/LLMAgent)
- diff: (required) One or more SEARCH/REPLACE blocks following this exact format:
  ```
  <<<<<<< SEARCH
  [exact content to find]
  =======
  [new content to replace with]
  >>>>>>> REPLACE
  ```
  Critical rules:
  1. SEARCH content must match the associated file section to find EXACTLY:
     * Match character-for-character including whitespace, indentation, line endings
     * Include all comments, docstrings, etc.
  2. SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will ONLY replace the first match occurrence.
     * Including multiple unique SEARCH/REPLACE blocks if you need to make multiple changes.
     * Include *just* enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
     * When using multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, list them in the order they appear in the file.
  3. Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise:
     * Break large SEARCH/REPLACE blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
     * Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
     * Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
     * Each line must be complete. Never truncate lines mid-way through as this can cause matching failures.
  4. Special operations:
     * To move code: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (one to delete from original + one to insert at new location)
     * To delete code: Use empty REPLACE section
Usage:
<replace_in_file>
<path>File path here</path>
<diff>
Search and replace blocks here
</diff>
</replace_in_file>

## search_files
Description: Request to perform a regex search across files in a specified directory, providing context-rich results. This tool searches for patterns or specific content across multiple files, displaying each match with encapsulating context.
Parameters:
- path: (required) The path of the directory to search in (relative to the current working directory e:/projects/LLMAgent). This directory will be recursively searched.
- regex: (required) The regular expression pattern to search for. Uses Rust regex syntax.
- file_pattern: (optional) Glob pattern to filter files (e.g., '*.ts' for TypeScript files). If not provided, it will search all files (*).
Usage:
<search_files>
<path>Directory path here</path>
<regex>Your regex pattern here</regex>
<file_pattern>file pattern here (optional)</file_pattern>
</search_files>

## list_files
Description: Request to list files and directories within the specified directory. If recursive is true, it will list all files and directories recursively. If recursive is false or not provided, it will only list the top-level contents. Do not use this tool to confirm the existence of files you may have created, as the user will let you know if the files were created successfully or not.
Parameters:
- path: (required) The path of the directory to list contents for (relative to the current working directory e:/projects/LLMAgent)
- recursive: (optional) Whether to list files recursively. Use true for recursive listing, false or omit for top-level only.
Usage:
<list_files>
<path>Directory path here</path>
<recursive>true or false (optional)</recursive>
</list_files>

## list_code_definition_names
Description: Request to list definition names (classes, functions, methods, etc.) used in source code files at the top level of the specified directory. This tool provides insights into the codebase structure and important constructs, encapsulating high-level concepts and relationships that are crucial for understanding the overall architecture.
Parameters:
- path: (required) The path of the directory (relative to the current working directory e:/projects/LLMAgent) to list top level source code definitions for.
Usage:
<list_code_definition_names>
<path>Directory path here</path>
</list_code_definition_names>

## browser_action
Description: Request to interact with a Puppeteer-controlled browser. Every action, except `close`, will be responded to with a screenshot of the browser's current state, along with any new console logs. You may only perform one browser action per message, and wait for the user's response including a screenshot and logs to determine the next action.
- The sequence of actions **must always start with** launching the browser at a URL, and **must always end with** closing the browser. If you need to visit a new URL that is not possible to navigate to from the current webpage, you must first close the browser, then launch again at the new URL.
- While the browser is active, only the `browser_action` tool can be used. No other tools should be called during this time. You may proceed to use other tools only after closing the browser. For example if you run into an error and need to fix a file, you must close the browser, then use other tools to make the necessary changes, then re-launch the browser to verify the result.
- The browser window has a resolution of **900x600** pixels. When performing any click actions, ensure the coordinates are within this resolution range.
- Before clicking on any elements such as icons, links, or buttons, you must consult the provided screenshot of the page to determine the coordinates of the element. The click should be targeted at the **center of the element**, not on its edges.
Parameters:
- action: (required) The action to perform. The available actions are:
    * launch: Launch a new Puppeteer-controlled browser instance at the specified URL. This **must always be the first action**.
        - Use with the `url` parameter to provide the URL.
        - Ensure the URL is valid and includes the appropriate protocol (e.g. http://localhost:3000/page, file:///path/to/file.html, etc.)
    * click: Click at a specific x,y coordinate.
        - Use with the `coordinate` parameter to specify the location.
        - Always click in the center of an element (icon, button, link, etc.) based on coordinates derived from a screenshot.
    * type: Type a string of text on the keyboard. You might use this after clicking on a text field to input text.
        - Use with the `text` parameter to provide the string to type.
    * scroll_down: Scroll down the page by one page height.
    * scroll_up: Scroll up the page by one page height.
    * close: Close the Puppeteer-controlled browser instance. This **must always be the final browser action**.
        - Example: `<action>close</action>`
- url: (optional) Use this for providing the URL for the `launch` action.
    * Example: <url>https://example.com</url>
- coordinate: (optional) The X and Y coordinates for the `click` action. Coordinates should be within the **900x600** resolution.
    * Example: <coordinate>450,300</coordinate>
- text: (optional) Use this for providing the text for the `type` action.
    * Example: <text>Hello, world!</text>
Usage:
<browser_action>
<action>Action to perform (e.g., launch, click, type, scroll_down, scroll_up, close)</action>
<url>URL to launch the browser at (optional)</url>
<coordinate>x,y coordinates (optional)</coordinate>
<text>Text to type (optional)</text>
</browser_action>

## use_mcp_tool
Description: Request to use a tool provided by a connected MCP server. Each MCP server can provide multiple tools with different capabilities. Tools have defined input schemas that specify required and optional parameters.

## ask_followup_question
Description: Ask the user a question to gather additional information needed to complete the task. This tool should be used when you encounter ambiguities, need clarification, or require more details to proceed effectively. It allows for interactive problem-solving by enabling direct communication with the user. Use this tool judiciously to maintain a balance between gathering necessary information and avoiding excessive back-and-forth.
Parameters:
- question: (required) The question to ask the user. This should be a clear, specific question that addresses the information you need.
- options: (optional) An array of 2-5 options for the user to choose from. Each option should be a string describing a possible answer. You may not always need to provide options, but it may be helpful in many cases where it can save the user from having to type out a response manually. IMPORTANT: NEVER include an option to toggle to Act mode, as this would be something you need to direct the user to do manually themselves if needed.
Usage:
<ask_followup_question>
<question>Your question here</question>
<options>
Array of options here (optional), e.g. ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"]
</options>
</ask_followup_question>

## attempt_completion
Description: After each tool use, the user will respond with the result of that tool use, i.e. if it succeeded or failed, along with any reasons for failure. Once you've received the results of tool uses and can confirm that the task is complete, use this tool to present the result of your work to the user. Optionally you may provide a CLI command to showcase the result of your work. The user may respond with feedback if they are not satisfied with the result, which you can use to make improvements and try again.
IMPORTANT NOTE: This tool CANNOT be used until you've confirmed from the user that any previous tool uses were successful. Failure to do so will result in code corruption and system failure. Before using this tool, you must ask yourself in <thinking></thinking> tags if you've confirmed from the user that any previous tool uses were successful. If not, then DO NOT use this tool.
Parameters:
- result: (required) The result of the task. Formulate this result in a way that is final and does not require further input from the user. Don't end your result with questions or offers for further assistance.
- command: (optional) A CLI command to execute to show a live demo of the result to the user. For example, use `open index.html` to display a created html website, or `open localhost:3000` to display a locally running development server. But DO NOT use commands like `echo` or `cat` that merely print text. This command should be valid for the current operating system. Ensure the command is properly formatted and does not contain any harmful instructions.
Usage:
<attempt_completion>
<result>
Your final result description here
</result>
<command>Command to demonstrate result (optional)</command>
</attempt_completion>

## new_task
Description: Request to create a new task with preloaded context covering the conversation with the user up to this point and key information for continuing with the new task. With this tool, you will create a detailed summary of the conversation so far, paying close attention to the user's explicit requests and your previous actions, with a focus on the most relevant information required for the new task.
Among other important areas of focus, this summary should be thorough in capturing technical details, code patterns, and architectural decisions that would be essential for continuing with the new task. The user will be presented with a preview of your generated context and can choose to create a new task or keep chatting in the current conversation. The user may choose to start a new task at any point.
Parameters:
- Context: (required) The context to preload the new task with. If applicable based on the current task, this should include:
  1. Current Work: Describe in detail what was being worked on prior to this request to create a new task. Pay special attention to the more recent messages / conversation.
  2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, coding conventions, and frameworks discussed, which might be relevant for the new task.
  3. Relevant Files and Code: If applicable, enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created for the task continuation. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and changes.
  4. Problem Solving: Document problems solved thus far and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.
  5. Pending Tasks and Next Steps: Outline all pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on, as well as list the next steps you will take for all outstanding work, if applicable. Include code snippets where they add clarity. For any next steps, include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were working on and where you left off. This should be verbatim to ensure there's no information loss in context between tasks. It's important to be detailed here.
Usage:
<new_task>
<context>context to preload new task with</context>
</new_task>

## plan_mode_respond
Description: Respond to the user's inquiry in an effort to plan a solution to the user's task. This tool should be used when you need to provide a response to a question or statement from the user about how you plan to accomplish the task. This tool is only available in PLAN MODE. The environment_details will specify the current mode, if it is not PLAN MODE then you should not use this tool. Depending on the user's message, you may ask questions to get clarification about the user's request, architect a solution to the task, and to brainstorm ideas with the user. For example, if the user's task is to create a website, you may start by asking some clarifying questions, then present a detailed plan for how you will accomplish the task given the context, and perhaps engage in a back and forth to finalize the details before the user switches you to ACT MODE to implement the solution.
Parameters:
- response: (required) The response to provide to the user. Do not try to use tools in this parameter, this is simply a chat response. (You MUST use the response parameter, do not simply place the response text directly within <plan_mode_respond> tags.)
Usage:
<plan_mode_respond>
<response>Your response here</response>
</plan_mode_respond>

## load_mcp_documentation
Description: Load documentation about creating MCP servers. This tool should be used when the user requests to create or install an MCP server (the user may ask you something along the lines of "add a tool" that does some function, in other words to create an MCP server that provides tools and resources that may connect to external APIs for example. You have the ability to create an MCP server and add it to a configuration file that will then expose the tools and resources for you to use with `use_mcp_tool` and `access_mcp_resource`). The documentation provides detailed information about the MCP server creation process, including setup instructions, best practices, and examples.
Parameters: None

<tool_name>create_issue</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "owner": "octocat",
  "repo": "hello-world",
  "title": "Found a bug",
  "body": "I'm having a problem with this.",
  "labels": ["bug", "help wanted"],
  "assignees": ["octocat"]
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

# Tool Use Guidelines

1. In <thinking> tags, assess what information you already have and what information you need to proceed with the task.
2. Choose the most appropriate tool based on the task and the tool descriptions provided. Assess if you need additional information to proceed, and which of the available tools would be most effective for gathering this information. For example using the list_files tool is more effective than running a command like `ls` in the terminal. It's critical that you think about each available tool and use the one that best fits the current step in the task.
3. If multiple actions are needed, use one tool at a time per message to accomplish the task iteratively, with each tool use being informed by the result of the previous tool use. Do not assume the outcome of any tool use. Each step must be informed by the previous step's result.
4. Formulate your tool use using the XML format specified for each tool.
5. After each tool use, the user will respond with the result of that tool use. This result will provide you with the necessary information to continue your task or make further decisions. This response may include:
  - Information about whether the tool succeeded or failed, along with any reasons for failure.
  - Linter errors that may have arisen due to the changes you made, which you'll need to address.
  - New terminal output in reaction to the changes, which you may need to consider or act upon.
  - Any other relevant feedback or information related to the tool use.
6. ALWAYS wait for user confirmation after each tool use before proceeding. Never assume the success of a tool use without explicit confirmation of the result from the user.

It is crucial to proceed step-by-step, waiting for the user's message after each tool use before moving forward with the task. This approach allows you to:
1. Confirm the success of each step before proceeding.
2. Address any issues or errors that arise immediately.
3. Adapt your approach based on new information or unexpected results.
4. Ensure that each action builds correctly on the previous ones.

By waiting for and carefully considering the user's response after each tool use, you can react accordingly and make informed decisions about how to proceed with the task. This iterative process helps ensure the overall success and accuracy of your work.

MCP SERVERS

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables communication between the system and locally running MCP servers that provide additional tools and resources to extend your capabilities.

# Connected MCP Servers

When a server is connected, you can use the server's tools via the `use_mcp_tool` tool, and access the server's resources via the `access_mcp_resource` tool.

EDITING FILES

You have access to two tools for working with files: **write_to_file** and **replace_in_file**. Understanding their roles and selecting the right one for the job will help ensure efficient and accurate modifications.

# write_to_file

## Purpose

- Create a new file, or overwrite the entire contents of an existing file.

## When to Use

- Initial file creation, such as when scaffolding a new project.  
- Overwriting large boilerplate files where you want to replace the entire content at once.
- When the complexity or number of changes would make replace_in_file unwieldy or error-prone.
- When you need to completely restructure a file's content or change its fundamental organization.

## Important Considerations

- Using write_to_file requires providing the file's complete final content.  
- If you only need to make small changes to an existing file, consider using replace_in_file instead to avoid unnecessarily rewriting the entire file.
- While write_to_file should not be your default choice, don't hesitate to use it when the situation truly calls for it.

# replace_in_file

## Purpose

- Make targeted edits to specific parts of an existing file without overwriting the entire file.

## When to Use

- Small, localized changes like updating a few lines, function implementations, changing variable names, modifying a section of text, etc.
- Targeted improvements where only specific portions of the file's content needs to be altered.
- Especially useful for long files where much of the file will remain unchanged.

## Advantages

- More efficient for minor edits, since you don't need to supply the entire file content.  
- Reduces the chance of errors that can occur when overwriting large files.

# Choosing the Appropriate Tool

- **Default to replace_in_file** for most changes. It's the safer, more precise option that minimizes potential issues.
- **Use write_to_file** when:
  - Creating new files
  - The changes are so extensive that using replace_in_file would be more complex or risky
  - You need to completely reorganize or restructure a file
  - The file is relatively small and the changes affect most of its content
  - You're generating boilerplate or template files

# Auto-formatting Considerations

- After using either write_to_file or replace_in_file, the user's editor may automatically format the file
- This auto-formatting may modify the file contents, for example:
  - Breaking single lines into multiple lines
  - Adjusting indentation to match project style (e.g. 2 spaces vs 4 spaces vs tabs)
  - Converting single quotes to double quotes (or vice versa based on project preferences)
  - Organizing imports (e.g. sorting, grouping by type)
  - Adding/removing trailing commas in objects and arrays
  - Enforcing consistent brace style (e.g. same-line vs new-line)
  - Standardizing semicolon usage (adding or removing based on style)
- The write_to_file and replace_in_file tool responses will include the final state of the file after any auto-formatting
- Use this final state as your reference point for any subsequent edits. This is ESPECIALLY important when crafting SEARCH blocks for replace_in_file which require the content to match what's in the file exactly.

# Workflow Tips

1. Before editing, assess the scope of your changes and decide which tool to use.
2. For targeted edits, apply replace_in_file with carefully crafted SEARCH/REPLACE blocks. If you need multiple changes, you can stack multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks within a single replace_in_file call.
3. For major overhauls or initial file creation, rely on write_to_file.
4. Once the file has been edited with either write_to_file or replace_in_file, the system will provide you with the final state of the modified file. Use this updated content as the reference point for any subsequent SEARCH/REPLACE operations, since it reflects any auto-formatting or user-applied changes.

By thoughtfully selecting between write_to_file and replace_in_file, you can make your file editing process smoother, safer, and more efficient.

ACT MODE V.S. PLAN MODE

In each user message, the environment_details will specify the current mode. There are two modes:

- ACT MODE: In this mode, you have access to all tools EXCEPT the plan_mode_respond tool.
 - In ACT MODE, you use tools to accomplish the user's task. Once you've completed the user's task, you use the attempt_completion tool to present the result of the task to the user.
- PLAN MODE: In this special mode, you have access to the plan_mode_respond tool.
 - In PLAN MODE, the goal is to gather information and get context to create a detailed plan for accomplishing the task, which the user will review and approve before they switch you to ACT MODE to implement the solution.
 - In PLAN MODE, when you need to converse with the user or present a plan, you should use the plan_mode_respond tool to deliver your response directly, rather than using <thinking> tags to analyze when to respond. Do not talk about using plan_mode_respond - just use it directly to share your thoughts and provide helpful answers.

## What is PLAN MODE?

- While you are usually in ACT MODE, the user may switch to PLAN MODE in order to have a back and forth with you to plan how to best accomplish the task. 
- When starting in PLAN MODE, depending on the user's request, you may need to do some information gathering e.g. using read_file or search_files to get more context about the task. You may also ask the user clarifying questions to get a better understanding of the task. You may return mermaid diagrams to visually display your understanding.
- Once you've gained more context about the user's request, you should architect a detailed plan for how you will accomplish the task. Returning mermaid diagrams may be helpful here as well.
- Then you might ask the user if they are pleased with this plan, or if they would like to make any changes. Think of this as a brainstorming session where you can discuss the task and plan the best way to accomplish it.
- If at any point a mermaid diagram would make your plan clearer to help the user quickly see the structure, you are encouraged to include a Mermaid code block in the response. (Note: if you use colors in your mermaid diagrams, be sure to use high contrast colors so the text is readable.)
- Finally once it seems like you've reached a good plan, ask the user to switch you back to ACT MODE to implement the solution.

CAPABILITIES

- You have access to tools that let you execute CLI commands on the user's computer, list files, view source code definitions, regex search, use the browser, read and edit files, and ask follow-up questions. These tools help you effectively accomplish a wide range of tasks, such as writing code, making edits or improvements to existing files, understanding the current state of a project, performing system operations, and much more.
- When the user initially gives you a task, a recursive list of all filepaths in the current working directory ('e:/projects/LLMAgent') will be included in environment_details. This provides an overview of the project's file structure, offering key insights into the project from directory/file names (how developers conceptualize and organize their code) and file extensions (the language used). This can also guide decision-making on which files to explore further. If you need to further explore directories such as outside the current working directory, you can use the list_files tool. If you pass 'true' for the recursive parameter, it will list files recursively. Otherwise, it will list files at the top level, which is better suited for generic directories where you don't necessarily need the nested structure, like the Desktop.
- You can use search_files to perform regex searches across files in a specified directory, outputting context-rich results that include surrounding lines. This is particularly useful for understanding code patterns, finding specific implementations, or identifying areas that need refactoring.
- You can use the list_code_definition_names tool to get an overview of source code definitions for all files at the top level of a specified directory. This can be particularly useful when you need to understand the broader context and relationships between certain parts of the code. You may need to call this tool multiple times to understand various parts of the codebase related to the task.
	- For example, when asked to make edits or improvements you might analyze the file structure in the initial environment_details to get an overview of the project, then use list_code_definition_names to get further insight using source code definitions for files located in relevant directories, then read_file to examine the contents of relevant files, analyze the code and suggest improvements or make necessary edits, then use the replace_in_file tool to implement changes. If you refactored code that could affect other parts of the codebase, you could use search_files to ensure you update other files as needed.
- You can use the execute_command tool to run commands on the user's computer whenever you feel it can help accomplish the user's task. When you need to execute a CLI command, you must provide a clear explanation of what the command does. Prefer to execute complex CLI commands over creating executable scripts, since they are more flexible and easier to run. Interactive and long-running commands are allowed, since the commands are run in the user's VSCode terminal. The user may keep commands running in the background and you will be kept updated on their status along the way. Each command you execute is run in a new terminal instance.
- You can use the browser_action tool to interact with websites (including html files and locally running development servers) through a Puppeteer-controlled browser when you feel it is necessary in accomplishing the user's task. This tool is particularly useful for web development tasks as it allows you to launch a browser, navigate to pages, interact with elements through clicks and keyboard input, and capture the results through screenshots and console logs. This tool may be useful at key stages of web development tasks-such as after implementing new features, making substantial changes, when troubleshooting issues, or to verify the result of your work. You can analyze the provided screenshots to ensure correct rendering or identify errors, and review console logs for runtime issues.
	- For example, if asked to add a component to a react website, you might create the necessary files, use execute_command to run the site locally, then use browser_action to launch the browser, navigate to the local server, and verify the component renders & functions correctly before closing the browser.
- You have access to MCP servers that may provide additional tools and resources. Each server may provide different capabilities that you can use to accomplish tasks more effectively.
- You can use LaTeX syntax in your responses to render mathematical expressions

====

RULES

- Your current working directory is: e:/projects/LLMAgent
- You cannot `cd` into a different directory to complete a task. You are stuck operating from 'e:/projects/LLMAgent', so be sure to pass in the correct 'path' parameter when using tools that require a path.
- Do not use the ~ character or $HOME to refer to the home directory.
- Before using the execute_command tool, you must first think about the SYSTEM INFORMATION context provided to understand the user's environment and tailor your commands to ensure they are compatible with their system. You must also consider if the command you need to run should be executed in a specific directory outside of the current working directory 'e:/projects/LLMAgent', and if so prepend with `cd`'ing into that directory && then executing the command (as one command since you are stuck operating from 'e:/projects/LLMAgent'). For example, if you needed to run `npm install` in a project outside of 'e:/projects/LLMAgent', you would need to prepend with a `cd` i.e. pseudocode for this would be `cd (path to project) && (command, in this case npm install)`.
- When using the search_files tool, craft your regex patterns carefully to balance specificity and flexibility. Based on the user's task you may use it to find code patterns, TODO comments, function definitions, or any text-based information across the project. The results include context, so analyze the surrounding code to better understand the matches. Leverage the search_files tool in combination with other tools for more comprehensive analysis. For example, use it to find specific code patterns, then use read_file to examine the full context of interesting matches before using replace_in_file to make informed changes.
- When creating a new project (such as an app, website, or any software project), organize all new files within a dedicated project directory unless the user specifies otherwise. Use appropriate file paths when creating files, as the write_to_file tool will automatically create any necessary directories. Structure the project logically, adhering to best practices for the specific type of project being created. Unless otherwise specified, new projects should be easily run without additional setup, for example most projects can be built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - which you can open in a browser.
- Be sure to consider the type of project (e.g. Python, JavaScript, web application) when determining the appropriate structure and files to include. Also consider what files may be most relevant to accomplishing the task, for example looking at a project's manifest file would help you understand the project's dependencies, which you could incorporate into any code you write.
- When making changes to code, always consider the context in which the code is being used. Ensure that your changes are compatible with the existing codebase and that they follow the project's coding standards and best practices.
- When you want to modify a file, use the replace_in_file or write_to_file tool directly with the desired changes. You do not need to display the changes before using the tool.
- Do not ask for more information than necessary. Use the tools provided to accomplish the user's request efficiently and effectively. When you've completed your task, you must use the attempt_completion tool to present the result to the user. The user may provide feedback, which you can use to make improvements and try again.
- You are only allowed to ask the user questions using the ask_followup_question tool. Use this tool only when you need additional details to complete a task, and be sure to use a clear and concise question that will help you move forward with the task. However if you can use the available tools to avoid having to ask the user questions, you should do so. For example, if the user mentions a file that may be in an outside directory like the Desktop, you should use the list_files tool to list the files in the Desktop and check if the file they are talking about is there, rather than asking the user to provide the file path themselves.
- When executing commands, if you don't see the expected output, assume the terminal executed the command successfully and proceed with the task. The user's terminal may be unable to stream the output back properly. If you absolutely need to see the actual terminal output, use the ask_followup_question tool to request the user to copy and paste it back to you.
- The user may provide a file's contents directly in their message, in which case you shouldn't use the read_file tool to get the file contents again since you already have it.
- Your goal is to try to accomplish the user's task, NOT engage in a back and forth conversation.
- The user may ask generic non-development tasks, such as "what's the latest news" or "look up the weather in San Diego", in which case you might use the browser_action tool to complete the task if it makes sense to do so, rather than trying to create a website or using curl to answer the question. However, if an available MCP server tool or resource can be used instead, you should prefer to use it over browser_action.
- NEVER end attempt_completion result with a question or request to engage in further conversation! Formulate the end of your result in a way that is final and does not require further input from the user.
- You are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from starting your messages with "Great", "Certainly", "Okay", "Sure". You should NOT be conversational in your responses, but rather direct and to the point. For example you should NOT say "Great, I've updated the CSS" but instead something like "I've updated the CSS". It is important you be clear and technical in your messages.
- When presented with images, utilize your vision capabilities to thoroughly examine them and extract meaningful information. Incorporate these insights into your thought process as you accomplish the user's task.
- At the end of each user message, you will automatically receive environment_details. This information is not written by the user themselves, but is auto-generated to provide potentially relevant context about the project structure and environment. While this information can be valuable for understanding the project context, do not treat it as a direct part of the user's request or response. Use it to inform your actions and decisions, but don't assume the user is explicitly asking about or referring to this information unless they clearly do so in their message. When using environment_details, explain your actions clearly to ensure the user understands, as they may not be aware of these details.
- Before executing commands, check the "Actively Running Terminals" section in environment_details. If present, consider how these active processes might impact your task. For example, if a local development server is already running, you wouldn't need to start it again. If no active terminals are listed, proceed with command execution as normal.
- When using the replace_in_file tool, you must include complete lines in your SEARCH blocks, not partial lines. The system requires exact line matches and cannot match partial lines. For example, if you want to match a line containing "const x = 5;", your SEARCH block must include the entire line, not just "x = 5" or other fragments.
- When using the replace_in_file tool, if you use multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, list them in the order they appear in the file. For example if you need to make changes to both line 10 and line 50, first include the SEARCH/REPLACE block for line 10, followed by the SEARCH/REPLACE block for line 50.
- It is critical you wait for the user's response after each tool use, in order to confirm the success of the tool use. For example, if asked to make a todo app, you would create a file, wait for the user's response it was created successfully, then create another file if needed, wait for the user's response it was created successfully, etc. Then if you want to test your work, you might use browser_action to launch the site, wait for the user's response confirming the site was launched along with a screenshot, then perhaps e.g., click a button to test functionality if needed, wait for the user's response confirming the button was clicked along with a screenshot of the new state, before finally closing the browser.
- MCP operations should be used one at a time, similar to other tool usage. Wait for confirmation of success before proceeding with additional operations.

OBJECTIVE

You accomplish a given task iteratively, breaking it down into clear steps and working through them methodically.

1. Analyze the user's task and set clear, achievable goals to accomplish it. Prioritize these goals in a logical order.
2. Work through these goals sequentially, utilizing available tools one at a time as necessary. Each goal should correspond to a distinct step in your problem-solving process. You will be informed on the work completed and what's remaining as you go.
3. Remember, you have extensive capabilities with access to a wide range of tools that can be used in powerful and clever ways as necessary to accomplish each goal. Before calling a tool, do some analysis within <thinking></thinking> tags. First, analyze the file structure provided in environment_details to gain context and insights for proceeding effectively. Then, think about which of the provided tools is the most relevant tool to accomplish the user's task. Next, go through each of the required parameters of the relevant tool and determine if the user has directly provided or given enough information to infer a value. When deciding if the parameter can be inferred, carefully consider all the context to see if it supports a specific value. If all of the required parameters are present or can be reasonably inferred, close the thinking tag and proceed with the tool use. BUT, if one of the values for a required parameter is missing, DO NOT invoke the tool (not even with fillers for the missing params) and instead, ask the user to provide the missing parameters using the ask_followup_question tool. DO NOT ask for more information on optional parameters if it is not provided.
4. Once you've completed the user's task, you must use the attempt_completion tool to present the result of the task to the user. You may also provide a CLI command to showcase the result of your task; this can be particularly useful for web development tasks, where you can run e.g. `open index.html` to show the website you've built.
5. The user may provide feedback, which you can use to make improvements and try again. But DO NOT continue in pointless back and forth conversations, i.e. don't end your responses with questions or offers for further assistance.

Okay, the user is asking about the weather in Los Angeles. Let me see what tools I have available. There's an MCP server connected for weather, right? The tools listed include get_alerts and get_forecast. Since the user is asking for the current weather, get_forecast seems appropriate. But wait, get_forecast requires latitude and longitude. The user didn't provide those. I need to get that information.

Looking at the environment details, there's a weather directory with a main.py and weather.py. Maybe those files have the necessary coordinates. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the MCP server's tools. But without the latitude and longitude, I can't proceed. So I should ask the user for those coordinates. Alternatively, maybe the weather.py or main.py has hardcoded values. Let me check the files listed. The weather directory includes weather.py, but I don't have the content. Wait, the user hasn't provided the contents of those files. So I can't infer the coordinates from there. 

Therefore, I need to ask the user for the latitude and longitude of Los Angeles. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to use the MCP server's get_forecast tool with default values, but that's not possible. The required parameters are latitude and longitude, which the user hasn't provided. So the correct step is to use ask_followup_question to request those details. The user might not know the exact coordinates, so I should prompt them for that information. Once I have those, I can use the get_forecast tool to retrieve the weather data.

Okay, the user asked for the weather in Los Angeles, and I needed their latitude and longitude. They provided "34.0522° N, 118.2437° W". Now, I need to use the MCP server's get_forecast tool. Let me check the available tools again. The weather server has get_forecast which requires latitude and longitude. The parameters are numbers, so I should convert the degrees into floats. Wait, the user's answer is in degrees with minutes? No, it's in decimal degrees. So 34.0522 is the latitude, 118.2437 is the longitude. But the coordinates are in degrees, so I need to pass them as numbers. The tool's input schema says latitude and longitude are numbers. So I'll call use_mcp_tool with server_name as 'weather' (from the connected servers list), tool_name 'get_forecast', and arguments with those values. Let me make sure the server name is correct. The user's environment details mention a weather server, so that's right. Then, after getting the forecast, I can present the result using attempt_completion. But first, I need to execute the tool call.

Okay, the user asked for the weather in Los Angeles. I first needed their latitude and longitude, which they provided as 34.0522° N, 118.2437° W. I used the get_forecast tool from the weather server with those coordinates. The response gave a forecast for the next few days.

Now, I need to present this information clearly. The user probably wants a summary of the weather, so I'll structure the response with today's and tonight's forecast, followed by the upcoming days. I should mention the temperature, wind conditions, and any notable weather events like fog or drizzle. Make sure it's easy to read and covers the key points without unnecessary details. Since the user is in ACT MODE, I should avoid any questions and just provide the final answer.

Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The user wants to set up an MCP server from the given GitHub repository while following specific instructions. First, I need to load the MCP documentation as per the rules. Then, I have to create a directory for the new MCP server, check the existing cline_mcp_settings.json file, and install the server. Finally, I need to demonstrate the server's capabilities using one of its tools.

Starting with loading the MCP documentation. The user mentioned the documentation is available at https://github.com/AgentDeskAI/browser-tools-mcp, so I'll use the load_mcp_documentation tool. That should fetch the documentation for the MCP server installation.

Next, the user specified using "github.com/AgentDeskAI/browser-tools-mcp" as the server name in cline_mcp_settings.json. But before editing that file, I need to check if it already exists and what's in it. So I should use the read_file tool to read the current cline_mcp_settings.json. Wait, but the user said to make sure to read the existing file before editing to not overwrite any existing servers. So first, read the existing settings, then proceed to add the new server.

Then, create the directory for the new MCP server. The user didn't specify the directory path, but typically, it might be something like 'mcp_servers' or similar. Let's assume 'mcp_servers' as the directory. Use the execute_command tool with 'mkdir mcp_servers' to create it. But wait, the user's current working directory is e:/projects/LLMAgent. So the directory would be within that. So the command would be 'mkdir mcp_servers' in that directory.

After creating the directory, install the MCP server. The installation involves running 'npx @agentdeskai/browser-tools-mcp@latest' in the IDE. But the user's shell is cmd.exe, so I need to make sure the command is compatible. Also, the user mentioned using commands aligned with their OS and shell best practices. So the command should be executed in the current working directory, which is e:/projects/LLMAgent.

Once installed, the user wants to demonstrate the server's capabilities. The README mentions using the browser-tools-server and the Chrome extension. But the task is to use one of the server's tools. The MCP server provides tools like runAccessibilityAudit, runPerformanceAudit, etc. However, to use these, the user needs to have the Chrome extension installed and the server running. So perhaps after installation, the next step is to run the server and then use one of the tools. But the user's task is to demonstrate the server's capabilities, so maybe run a sample audit using one of the tools.

But first, the installation steps: the user needs to install the MCP server, then run the browser-tools-server. The README says to run 'npx @agentdeskai/browser-tools-server@latest' in a new terminal. So after installing the MCP server, the next step is to start the server.

But the user's current working directory is e:/projects/LLMAgent, so the commands should be executed there. Also, the user's environment has a current working directory with files like weather/, src/, etc. So the directory for the MCP server would be within that.

Wait, the user's instructions say to create the directory for the new MCP server before starting installation. So first, create the directory, then install the server there. But the installation command is 'npx @agentdeskai/browser-tools-mcp@latest' in the IDE. So maybe the directory is where the server is installed, but the user's current working directory is e:/projects/LLMAgent, so the directory might be a subdirectory there.

Alternatively, the MCP server might be installed in the current directory. But the user's instructions say to create the directory for the new MCP server before starting installation. So perhaps the directory is 'mcp_servers' under e:/projects/LLMAgent.

So steps:

1. Load the MCP documentation using load_mcp_documentation.
2. Read the existing cline_mcp_settings.json to check for existing servers.
3. Create the directory for the new MCP server (e.g., mcp_servers).
4. Install the MCP server using npx command in the IDE.
5. Run the browser-tools-server command in a new terminal.
6. Demonstrate the server's capabilities by using one of its tools, like running an audit.

But the user's task is to set up the MCP server, so after installation, the next step is to run the server and then use one of its tools. However, the user's environment might already have some servers running. The environment_details show that there's a weather/ directory with some files, but that's probably unrelated.

Wait, the user's current working directory is e:/projects/LLMAgent. So the steps would be:

- Create the directory for the new MCP server (e.g., mcp_servers).
- Install the MCP server using npx @agentdeskai/browser-tools-mcp@latest in the IDE.
- Run the browser-tools-server command in a new terminal.
- Then, use one of the server's tools, like runAccessibilityAudit, but that requires the Chrome extension to be installed and the server to be running.

But the user's task is to set up the server, so after installation, the user needs to verify that the server is running and that the tools are available.

So first, I'll proceed to load the documentation, then check the existing settings, create the directory, install the server, run the server, and then use a tool.

But the user's environment_details show that there's a weather/ directory with some files, but that's probably not relevant. The main task is to set up the new MCP server.

So the first step is to load the documentation. Then check the existing cline_mcp_settings.json. Then create the directory, install the server, run the server, and then use a tool.

But the user's instructions say to use the tools step by step, and each step requires confirmation. So first, load the documentation.

Wait, the user's task says to start by loading the MCP documentation. So the first tool use should be load_mcp_documentation. Then, read the existing cline_mcp_settings.json to check for existing servers. Then create the directory, install the server, run the server, and then use a tool.

So the first tool is load_mcp_documentation.

## Creating an MCP Server

When creating MCP servers, it's important to understand that they operate in a non-interactive environment. The server cannot initiate OAuth flows, open browser windows, or prompt for user input during runtime. All credentials and authentication tokens must be provided upfront through environment variables in the MCP settings configuration. For example, Spotify's API uses OAuth to get a refresh token for the user, but the MCP server cannot initiate this flow. While you can walk the user through obtaining an application client ID and secret, you may have to create a separate one-time setup script (like get-refresh-token.js) that captures and logs the final piece of the puzzle: the user's refresh token (i.e. you might run the script using execute_command which would open a browser for authentication, and then log the refresh token so that you can see it in the command output for you to use in the MCP settings configuration).

Unless the user specifies otherwise, new MCP servers should be created in: D:\�ĵ�\Cline\MCP

### Example MCP Server

For example, if the user wanted to give you the ability to retrieve weather information, you could create an MCP server that uses the OpenWeather API to get weather information, add it to the MCP settings configuration file, and then notice that you now have access to new tools and resources in the system prompt that you might use to show the user your new capabilities.

The following example demonstrates how to build an MCP server that provides weather data functionality. While this example shows how to implement resources, resource templates, and tools, in practice you should prefer using tools since they are more flexible and can handle dynamic parameters. The resource and resource template implementations are included here mainly for demonstration purposes of the different MCP capabilities, but a real weather server would likely just expose tools for fetching weather data. (The following steps are for macOS)

1. Use the `create-typescript-server` tool to bootstrap a new project in the default MCP servers directory:

```bash
cd D:\�ĵ�\Cline\MCP
npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server weather-server
cd weather-server
# Install dependencies
npm install axios
```

This will create a new project with the following structure:

```
weather-server/
  ├── package.json
      {
        ...
        "type": "module", // added by default, uses ES module syntax (import/export) rather than CommonJS (require/module.exports) (Important to know if you create additional scripts in this server repository like a get-refresh-token.js script)
        "scripts": {
          "build": "tsc && node -e "require('fs').chmodSync('build/index.js', '755')"",
          ...
        }
        ...
      }
  ├── tsconfig.json
  └── src/
      └── weather-server/
          └── index.ts      # Main server implementation
```

2. Replace `src/index.ts` with the following:

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env node

      process.exit(0);
    });
  }

const server = new WeatherServer();
server.run().catch(console.error);
```

(Remember: This is just an example–you may use different dependencies, break the implementation up into multiple files, etc.)

3. Build and compile the executable JavaScript file

```bash
npm run build
```

4. Whenever you need an environment variable such as an API key to configure the MCP server, walk the user through the process of getting the key. For example, they may need to create an account and go to a developer dashboard to generate the key. Provide step-by-step instructions and URLs to make it easy for the user to retrieve the necessary information. Then use the ask_followup_question tool to ask the user for the key, in this case the OpenWeather API key.

5. Install the MCP Server by adding the MCP server configuration to the settings file located at 'c:\Users\tdf1\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\globalStorage\saoudrizwan.claude-dev\settings\cline_mcp_settings.json'. The settings file may have other MCP servers already configured, so you would read it first and then add your new server to the existing `mcpServers` object.

IMPORTANT: Regardless of what else you see in the MCP settings file, you must default any new MCP servers you create to disabled=false and autoApprove=[].

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    ...,
    "weather": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/weather-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "OPENWEATHER_API_KEY": "user-provided-api-key"
      }
    },
  }
}
```

(Note: the user may also ask you to install the MCP server to the Claude desktop app, in which case you would read then modify `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS for example. It follows the same format of a top level `mcpServers` object.)

6. After you have edited the MCP settings configuration file, the system will automatically run all the servers and expose the available tools and resources in the 'Connected MCP Servers' section. (Note: If you encounter a 'not connected' error when testing a newly installed mcp server, a common cause is an incorrect build path in your MCP settings configuration. Since compiled JavaScript files are commonly output to either 'dist/' or 'build/' directories, double-check that the build path in your MCP settings matches where your files are actually being compiled. E.g. If you assumed 'build' as the folder, check tsconfig.json to see if it's using 'dist' instead.)

7. Now that you have access to these new tools and resources, you may suggest ways the user can command you to invoke them - for example, with this new weather tool now available, you can invite the user to ask "what's the weather in San Francisco?"

## Editing MCP Servers

The user may ask to add tools or resources that may make sense to add to an existing MCP server (listed under 'Connected MCP Servers' below: weather, e.g. if it would use the same API. This would be possible if you can locate the MCP server repository on the user's system by looking at the server arguments for a filepath. You might then use list_files and read_file to explore the files in the repository, and use replace_in_file to make changes to the files.

However some MCP servers may be running from installed packages rather than a local repository, in which case it may make more sense to create a new MCP server.

# MCP Servers Are Not Always Necessary

The user may not always request the use or creation of MCP servers. Instead, they might provide tasks that can be completed with existing tools. While using the MCP SDK to extend your capabilities can be useful, it's important to understand that this is just one specialized type of task you can accomplish. You should only implement MCP servers when the user explicitly requests it (e.g., "add a tool that...").

Remember: The MCP documentation and example provided above are to help you understand and work with existing MCP servers or create new ones when requested by the user. You already have access to tools and capabilities that can be used to accomplish a wide range of tasks.

Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The user wants to set up an MCP server from the given GitHub repository, following specific rules. First, I need to load the MCP documentation to understand the process. Then, I have to create the directory for the new MCP server, make sure the existing cline_mcp_settings.json is read before editing, and install the server. Also, I need to demonstrate the server's capabilities by using one of its tools.

Starting with the documentation, the user mentioned loading the MCP documentation. So I'll use the load_mcp_documentation tool. Next, the server name should be "github.com/AgentDeskAI/browser-tools-mcp". I need to create the directory for this server. The default directory is D:\�ĵ�\Cline\MCP, so I'll check if that exists. If not, create it.

Then, I need to read the existing cline_mcp_settings.json to avoid overwriting. The user's current working directory is e:/projects/LLMAgent, so I should check the settings file there. Wait, the user's environment details show that the cline_mcp_settings.json might be in the global storage, like C:\Users\tdf1\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\globalStorage\saoudrizwan.claude-dev\settings\cline_mcp_settings.json. But the user's current directory is e:/projects/LLMAgent, so maybe the settings file is in that directory? Or maybe it's a separate location. I need to confirm.

Wait, the user's environment details show that in the VSCode visible files, there's llm.log, and open tabs include weather/README.md, etc. The current working directory is e:/projects/LLMAgent. The settings file might be in the global storage, but the user's home directory is C:/Users/tdf1. So the path to cline_mcp_settings.json is likely C:\Users\tdf1\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\globalStorage\saoudrizwan.c
